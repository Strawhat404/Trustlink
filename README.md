# Trustlink - Secure Telegram Group Escrow Bot

Trustlink is a powerful, secure, and reliable Telegram bot designed to facilitate the buying and selling of Telegram groups through a trusted escrow system. It leverages the security of cryptocurrency payments and a robust dispute resolution process to ensure safe transactions for both buyers and sellers.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Trustlink bot in your local environment.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Django 4.x
- A Telegram Bot Token (get one from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather))
- A Coinbase Commerce account and API keys
- `ngrok` for local webhook testing

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/trustlink.git
cd trustlink
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Now, edit the `.env` file with your favorite editor (e.g., `nano .env`) and add your keys:

```ini
# Django Settings
SECRET_KEY='your-django-secret-key'
DEBUG=True

# Database (default is SQLite)
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname

# Telegram Bot
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN='your-telegram-bot-token'

# Coinbase Commerce
COINBASE_COMMERCE_API_KEY='your-coinbase-api-key'
COINBASE_COMMERCE_WEBHOOK_SECRET='your-coinbase-webhook-secret'
```

### 4. Set Up the Database

Run the database migrations to create the necessary tables:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser to access the Django admin dashboard:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 5. Run the Application

You'll need to run two services in separate terminals:

**Terminal 1: Start the Telegram Bot**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py run_bot
```

**Terminal 2: Start the Django Server (for webhooks)**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py start_server
```

### 6. Configure the Webhook

For local development, you need to expose your server to the internet using `ngrok`.

**Terminal 3: Start ngrok**

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

- Copy the HTTPS URL provided by `ngrok` (e.g., `https://random-string.ngrok.io`).
- Go to your Coinbase Commerce dashboard, navigate to **Settings > Webhook subscriptions**, and add a new webhook pointing to `YOUR_NGROK_URL/escrow/webhooks/coinbase/`.

For detailed instructions, see `WEBHOOK_SETUP.md`.
